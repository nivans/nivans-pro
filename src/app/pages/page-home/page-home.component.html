  <div class='about'>
    I am professional pianist and had graduated at Academy of Music in 2013. Almost 10 years
    I am interested in web developments. I am really like to programming and I am sure that
    programming and music has much lesser diffirences than It could seem. Only right, beautiful
    structures, forms in arts and the same thing in programming can stay alive long time. Besides
    programming and music I have also interests in snooker, chess and poker. This choice is not
    random. There are many things I like about work. A lot of harmony, balance and ... difficulties.
